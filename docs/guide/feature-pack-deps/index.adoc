## Feature-pack dependencies

Feature-pack may depend on one or more other feature-packs. Feature-pack dependencies are expressed in `feature-pack.xml` file. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:feature-pack:2.0"
                location="fp1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0" >
    <dependencies>
        <dependency location="fp2@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):2#2.0.1"/>
        <dependency location="fp3@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.2" familyMemberAllowed="true"/>
    </dependencies>
    <default-packages>
        <package name="package1"/>
        <package name="package2"/>
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>
----

In this case feature-pack `fp1` depends on feature-packs `fp2` and `fp3`. And if a user requests to install `fp1`, feature-packs `fp2` and `fp3` will be installed by the mechanism implicitly as dependencies of `fp1`.\
Note that the dependency on `fp3` allows that, at provisioning time, a member of the family of `fp3` can be used to replace `fp3`. 

If we further assume that `fp3` depends on feature-pack `fp4` and `fp2` and `fp4` donâ€™t have any further dependencies. The effective package set of the distribution provisioned from `fp1` will consist of:

*   the effective package set of `fp1`;

*   the effective package set of `fp2`;

*   the effective package set of `fp3`;

*   the effective package set of `fp4`.

NOTE: `fp2` and `fp3` are called *direct* dependencies of `fp1`, while `fp4` is called a *transitive* dependency of `fp1` and a *direct* dependency of `fp3`.
